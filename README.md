# Animate SVG Icons with CSS

## Why? 
* Understand the parts of SVG elements that can be animated
* CSS Animations are lightweight and easy to implement and improve user experience
* Learn CSS tranforms, transitions, and keyframes
* Add existing animation libraries to your project and save time
* Use SVG icons in your future projects

## How?
* Use CSS `@keyframes` to define animations
* Use `transform` and `transition` properties to animate SVG elements
* Use `animation` property to apply animations to SVG elements

##notes
* want to do three separate animations; one for the 'fingers', one for the whole paw, 
and one for having everything show up individually. 
the idea was from adding classes to the parts. But the animations do not want to work with me. 
Also, layering animations seems to cancel out each other, I do not know how to fix it yet.
